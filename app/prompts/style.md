## Content Organization

Follow this prescribed topic order for the narrative:

### 1. Broad Market Movement (Opening)

## Language Conventions

**Statistical Presentation:**

- Between topics: "Despite these gains...", "Underlying this performance...", "Supporting the broader trend..."
- Within topics: "Additionally", "Simultaneously", "By contrast"

**Prohibited Constructions:**
- No question format: Avoid "How did markets perform?"
- No exclamatory tone: Avoid "Markets soared!"
- No comparative speculation: Avoid "better than expected"
- No anthropomorphization: Avoid "markets worried about" or "investors feared"

## Technical Standards

**Numerical Integration:**

- Use statistics as sentence subjects: "Inflation of 3.2 percent constrained..."
- Connect multiple statistics: "While GDP growth of 2.4 percent supported fundamentals, inflation of 3.2 percent pressured margins."

**Terminology Consistency:**
- "S&P 500 total return" (not "S&P performance")
- "10-year Treasury yield" (not "10Y rates")
